  ### Project Overview

  This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow in Microsoft Excel — from data cleaning and transformation to building an interactive dashboard.
  The dataset represents a retail company’s transactions across multiple regions, categories, and salespersons between 2023 and 2024.

  ### Data Source

  This data source is a "Retail Sales Data.xlsx" file which contains information concerning reatail sales in Nigerian regions.

  ### Tools

  - Microsoft Excel
 
  ### Data Cleaning

   To prepare the dataset for accurate analysis, I performed several data transformation steps like

  - Removed duplicates and blanks to ensure data integrity.
  - Standardized date formats to dd-mm-yyyy for consistency across records & removed unnecessary spaces.
  - Corrected data entry errors such as typos and inconsistent capitalization .
 
  ### Data Analysis
  
   To better understand sales performance, I explored the dataset through the following analytical questions:

  - How did monthly sales trend between 2023 and 2024?
  - Which region contributed the most to overall revenue?
  - Who are the top-performing salespersons?
  - How do product categories perform across different regions?
 
   To answer these questions, I utilized PivotTables enhanced with slicers for interactivity.  While PivotTables effectively highlight individual insights, they can be limited when viewed in isolation.
   To provide a broader, more connected perspective of the data, I developed an interactive dashboard that can be explored and used for further analysis.

  ### Results

  From the analysis, I found out the following :
  
  - Sales dipped in mid-2023, followed by a recovery in Q3.
  - North region contributed the most to total sales .
  - Top 5 salespersons accounted for over 60% of total sales.
  - Performance varied regionally, suggesting potential for targeted campaigns.
 
  ### Recommendations

  - Review pricing and marketing in low-sales regions.
  - Focus on high-performing regions and salespersons.
  - Optimize inventory based on seasonal demand.
 
  ### Limitations

  At first, the dataset was cluttered with duplicates and confusing abbreviations. Once cleaned and standardized, it became far more readable and ready for analysis and visualization.
